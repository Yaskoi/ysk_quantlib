# ðŸ§  ysk_quantlib

`ysk_quantlib` is a custom quantitative finance library that I designed to simplify the intermediate steps of my projects with easy-to-use features that produce clear results and clean graphs. It's not really an efficiently coded library, and I probably haven't optimized it for computational speed, but I'm not a quant developer, I'm not really great with efficient coding, and if it works, I'm fine with it as it is. But I published it because it's an easy-to-use tool, and I'm open to any suggestions for improvement. So the library includes tools for:

- Option pricing (Black-Scholes, Heston, Binomial Trees, ...)
- Greeks computation
- Delta hedging simulation
- Volatility estimation
- Stationarity and cointegration tests
- Technical Analysis
